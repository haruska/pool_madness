<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>
  Thanks for signing up for the <%= ENV['TOURNEY_NAME'] %> pool! Here is some additional information you might find
  helpful.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Site URL</b>: <%= link_to root_url, root_url %><br />
  <b>Username</b>: <%= @user.email %><br />
  <b>Password</b>: What you filled in on the site.
</p>

<p>You can get to your brackets anytime by returning to the site, clicking login, and filling out your credentials.</p>

<p>Some useful links:</p>
<ul>
  <li><%= link_to 'Rules and Scoring', rules_url %></li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Payment Types', payments_url %></li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Forgotten Password', new_user_password_url %></li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you changed your mind and do not want to enter the pool, that's fine. Please delete your bracket. You can do so
  by going to the bracket page and clicking "delete bracket" on the bottom of the page. Likewise, if you filled
  out multiple brackets but there is one you don't want, please delete it.
</p>

<p>
  You can continue to update your brackets until tip off on Thursday, even after you pay the entry fee. After Thursday,
  they will be locked in.
</p>

<p>
  If you plan on paying cash in person, <b>please let an administrator know</b> so they can mark you as paid. Any brackets
  unpaid at tip off will be removed from the pool.
</p>

<p>
  Before the tournament starts, you can only see the brackets you've personally filled out. After tip off, all brackets
  will be available for viewing. Simply go back to the site (<%= root_url %>) and login to see them all.
</p>

<p>Good Luck,<br/>
John, Jason and Chris Haruska</p>
